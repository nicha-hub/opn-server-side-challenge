# opn-server-side-challenge
This repository was created to store my code challenge for the OPN Examination.
There are 3 folders.
1. RESTFUL-API: stores the code for the first question.
2. DATABASE: stores the MySQL code for the second question.
3. CODING: stores the Node.js code for the third question.
